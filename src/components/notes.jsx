          Well, this was certainly a first for me on several levels. I'm just glad that I can say that I did enjoy doing this--even if it ends up being for nothing, I learned something, and that's something in itself.

          Concerning your question about one thing I'd like to learn, I have plenty. But one that I can really point to without much thought is C. I've always read articles that said to start out with C because it'll give you a pretty solid foundation, and from what I've heard about it I can understand those authors' point. The lowest leveled language I've worked with is Java, if that even counts as low-level; I want to try my hand at coding like it's the 80s (Earlier? Later? I don't know, it's been around so long). I'm definitely not interested in trying Assembly Language or anything of that sort, but I really would like to learn C one day.

          Well, I guess, this is the end of this little project. I'd just like to say thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to try this out, I enjoyed making it and I hope you enjoy going through it. It's not perfect, and I accept that (otherwise you'd never see this), but I guess the fact is that I'll never be perfect, and that's okay (why refactoring is a continuous process). Thanks for having such an inviting job posting without sounding like a complete bs factory, I appreciate things like that. Well, I'l be here working (seriously, I had to stop myself from attempting to add more features to this) and improving--I await your honest response.
