          Well...this was certainly a first for me on several levels. I'm just glad that I can say that I did enjoy doing this--even if it ends up being for nothing, I learned something, and that's something in itself.

          Anyways, I can be found on twitter and github. I don't really do anything else; I'm not all that social online. I'm an open book in person, but prefer to remain conservative about what I give to the entire world about me.

          Concerning your question about one thing I'd like to learn, I have plenty. But one can I can really point to without much thought is C. I've always read articles that said to start out with C because it'll give you a pretty solid foundation, and from what I've heard about it I can understand those authors' point. The lowest leveled language I've worked with is Java, if that even counts as low-level; I want to try my hand at coding like it's the 80s (Earlier? Later? I don't know, it's been around so long). I'm definitely not interested in trying Assembly Language or anything of that sort, but I really would like to (kinda) master C one day.

          Well, I guess, this is the end of this little project. I'd just like to say thank you for giving me the oppurtunity to try this out, I enjoyed making it and I hope you enjoy reading it. Thanks for having such an inviting job posting without sounding like a complete bs factory, I appreciate things like that. Well, I'l be here working and improving--I await your honest response.
