        <p>My reason is simple, really. You guys said you wanted somebody who can use React + Redux--I've never used them before and was looking for an excuse to try it out anyways--what better time than now? With that said, I'd like to say thank you for giving me something tangible to try out React on. And I'm glad I did this, because I've learned plenty, and getting things to work in a 'pure' way was a welcome challenge. Thanks again, and without further ado...</p>
