        <h1>So you may be asking... WHY?</h1>
        <br />
        <p>My reason is simple, really. You guys said you wanted somebody who can use React + Redux--I've never used them before and was looking for an excuse to try it out--what better time than now? With that said, I'd like to say thank you for giving me something tangible to try out React on. And I'm glad I did this, because I've learned and surmounted the greatest task of setting up Webpack properly for React development after a few hours of googling and trying, and this was a fun exercise for myself.</p>
